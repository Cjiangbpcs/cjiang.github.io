# Predictive Planning Solutions (PPS)?

Only one out of every ten data science projects make it into production, a striking statistic revealed at Transform July 2019, a conference held in San Francisco to accelerate business with Artificial Intelligence. Many factors contribute to this low percentage of productionalizations, however, one critical reason is that the data science team does not own the end-to-end pipeline to be able to bridge the gap between the predictive models and actionable planning to drive measurable business value. 

Predictive planning is developed at Blueprint to serve as an effective solution to fill that gap that results in the low percentage of data science projects productionalizations. It allows the data science team to run through the end-to-end data science pipeline, ensures that all data science projects with satisfying accuracy make it into production, and enables the business leaders to make informative decisions based on the quantified business values. 

For PPS, the predictive models aim to tackle the pain points of the workflow. The actionable planning aims to take the insights from predictive models to strategic planning.The measurable business values aim to provide business leaders concrete metrics to make decisions, which involves efficiency, accuracy, and revenue within a time frame. 

Predictive planning solution starts with a comprehensive evaluation of the business requirements, follows with a well-defined data science problem with measurable business metrics, and ends with an automatic platform linking predictive models with actionable planning tool with iterable capabilities. 

PPS serves as a long-term solution to accelerate business with artificial intelligence, as it is: 1) problem-agnostic, any data science problem that can be solved by predictive interventions is applicable; 2) values-measurable, any model with planning can be driven to its quantifiable values; 3) optimization-guaranteed, every project is allowed to be continuously iterated and optimized to make optimal impacts.
